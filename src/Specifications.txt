Overall Goal: 
	To create a program (GUI) where you can store usernames and passwords, and then with one click, 
	be able to automatically open a variety of programs for some activity 
	(i.e., grading window from skyward pops up without having to navigate there). 

Use Cases:

	Use Case: Accessing Programs
	Actor: User - Teacher
	Flow:
		When opening the program, a tab will appear including options to access Skyward gradebook, skyward attendance, 
		create new assignments on teams, email/outlook, frontline absence management, frontline – evaluation. 
	Alternating flow 0: 
		If the teacher clicks on Skyward gradebook, the program opens chrome and automatically logs into Skyward. 
		Without user input it will navigate to Skyward gradebook. 
	Alternating flow 1: 
		If the teacher clicks on Skyward attendance, the program opens chrome and automatically logs into Skyward. 
		Without user input it will navigate to Skyward attendance. 
	Alternating flow 2:
		If the teacher clicks on creating new assignments on teams, the program opens teams and logs in if necessary. 
		Without user input it will navigate to assignments on teams. 
	Alternating flow 3:
		If the teacher clicks on email/outlook, the program opens outlook in chrome and logs in if necessary. 
	Alternating flow 4:
		If the teacher clicks on frontline absence management, the program opens frontline and logs in if necessary. 
		Without user input it will navigate to absence management on frontline.
	Alternating flow 5:
		If the teacher clicks on frontline evaluations, the program opens frontline and logs in if necessary. 
		Without user input it will navigate to evaluations on frontline. 

	Use Case: Accessing Programs
	Actor: User - Teacher
	Flow:
		When opening the program, a tab will appear which will include the option to create a new link. 
		The user clicks on that option, and it brings up a new tab in which the user can input an app or 
		website they want access to along with username or password. After the user inputs that information 
		it returns to the main program tab in which the new quick link is added.  

Project Restrictions:
	Take up as little space as possible, doesn’t take up all space on the hard drive 
	Computer stays usable before and after the main part of the app runs (opening all 3 windows) 
	Must be more efficient/take less time than manually opening programs and signing in to them 

External Resources: 
	Websites that Mr. Danaee needs to sign into* 
	Swing to make a GUI 
	Google chrome to open any websites 
	Robot class and/or Selenium to automate moving through webpages 
	Passwords stored in a local folder (possibly encrypted), so the passwords are not shared on any cloud service* 
	Teams API that allows us to navigate through the application 
	Stored as addresses in an external text document*

Requirements 
	Must have: 
		The ability to store usernames and passwords.   
		Ability to access and open Google Chrome 
		Ability to automatically log into specified websites 
		Ability to automatically navigate through webpages 
	Nice to have: 
		Ability for the user to add new quick links to the program 
	Time permitting:
		Ability to open Mutiple bowsers from one quick link 
		Keeping everything to one window when applicable  
		Encryption on local folder storing usernames and passwords 
		Visual security precautions when inputting passwords (changing password characters to dots)

Clarifications from Mr. Danaee: 
	Quick links to the following would be required: 
	Skyward - gradebook 
	Skyward - attendance
	Frontline - absence management 
	Frontline - evaluations 
	Wishlist: The ability to add new quick links myself as needed. (i.e. AP Classroom, Mastering Biology, ExploreLearing, etc)
